            <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
            <p>
                The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. 
                You play on a three by three game board. The first 
                player is known as X and the second is O. Players 
                alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until 
                either oppent has three in a row or all nine squares 
                are filled. X always goes first, and in the event 
                that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is 
                called a cat game.
                <br><br>
                Enter your name as Player 1 and click the X to confirm.
                If you want to play with a friend, have them enter their
                name in the slot for Player 2 and click the O to confirm.
                <br><br>
                If you would like to play against the computer, enter 
                your name as player 1, press X to confirm and then leave
                Player 2's name blank.  Press O to confirm the computer 
                will play against you!
                <br><br>
                If you want to restart the game, click the restart button.
