            <p>
                Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, 
                X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. 
                The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks 
                in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. 
                It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play 
                from both players.
