## Project Description

This project is a simple game played in the browser, with no state managing or data saving. Players may play against another person(on the same browser window) or they may choose to play against a computer AI. Game recognizes wins for any player/computer as well as scratch games. There is a restart option that allows players to start a new game or restart the current game.

Deployed to Glitch. 

## Future Plans

* A complete rework, this thing is ugly and broken.
* A Jest test suite to make sure I have complete coverage of my code 
* Rebuild with Angular, for practice
