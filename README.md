Version Number 1.1 - Working but Ugly

## Project Description

This project is a simple game played in the browser, with no state managing or data saving. Players may play against another person on the same browser window. Game recognizes wins for any player as well as scratch games. There is a restart option that allows players to start a new game. 

Play the game live => [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://simpletictactoe.glitch.me/).

## Installation

Installation is currently very simple. Clone the repo and then navigate to the base directory. Open the index.html file in the browser of your choice and you can play the game on a localHost port. To play the game live, follow the link in the description.

## Documentation

A static page app. Files include index.html, style.css, scripts.js. No documentation as of now, but will add during the rework.
Deployed to Glitch. 

## Test Suite

Test Suite is done with Jest, and as of now only tests the Game factory function which holds all the game logic. Will expand to include tests for the DOM.

## Future Plans

* A complete rework, this thing is ugly and ~~broken~~.
* A Jest test suite to make sure I have coverage of my code
* Offer a computer opponent
* Rebuild with Angular, for practice

## Past Versions

* VN 1.0 - Broken and Sad
